## PHP Single & Multi-line Comments

Single line comments are similar to Javascript, just put "//" or "#" before the comment or line of code you don't want to be run.

```
<?php

// This is a sinlge line comment
# This is also a a sinlge line comment

?>
```

Multi-line comments are the same as CSS and JS, just put "/* before the lines of code or comment, and add "*/" to the end.

```
/* This is a multi-line comment,
   which can also be used to prevent
   a block of code from being run */
```
